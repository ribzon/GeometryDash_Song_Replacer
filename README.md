# GeometryDash_Song_Replacer
Geometry Dash Song Replacer, does what it says replaces geometry dash songs

This Python code defines a GUI application using the tkinter library that allows users to replace an MP3 file in a specific folder. The application has four widgets: two labels, an entry field, and two buttons.

The first button ("Select File") allows users to browse their file system and choose the MP3 file they want to replace. The selected file must have the ".mp3" extension.

The second widget is an entry field that allows users to specify a new name for the file they want to replace. If no new file name is entered, an error message is displayed.

The third widget is a button ("Execute") that checks whether a file has been selected and a new file name has been entered. If these conditions are met, the program replaces the selected file with a new file that has the specified name. The new file is stored in a specific folder, and the old file is deleted.

The fourth widget is a button ("Join Discord Server") that opens a link to a Discord server in a web browser.

Overall, this code is designed to provide a simple graphical interface to replace an MP3 file in a specific folder, using basic file handling operations and the tkinter and webbrowser libraries.
